# Hey, I’m Alvaro 👋

I'm a Bath uni student passionate about making a positive impact. Life’s about taking risks and making moves, not playing it safe. As Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, says:  
*"If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late."*  

It’s a reminder that taking risks early and learning fast is key to real progress.

## What Drives Me

Making things, not just code. Building stuff that matters, driven by the desire to create and keep improving.

---

## Skills & Tech (Short & Sweet)

Python, TypeScript, Go (learning), Arduino, Linux, shell scripting, web dev, embedded systems, PCB design, MATLAB, AutoCAD, LaTeX, Git, databases, data analysis — all mixed with the usual uni grind and some real-world hustle.

---

## What I’m Diving Into

Go for real automation and scripts. Linux and pentesting vibes. Uni projects with Arduino and hardware. Always learning.
